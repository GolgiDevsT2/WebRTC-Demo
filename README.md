# WebRTC demonstration application by Golgi

## Description

This is a demonstration WebRTC project created by Golgi. WebRTC is a Real-Time Communications API for browser-to-browser applications. It provides peer-to-peer connections between end-points streaming media (voice and video) or data - you can read more about the project at the official [WebRTC web site](http://www.webrtc.org/). 

This project provides code for a web page that creates a one-to-one voice and video call between two web browsers. Golgi's JavaScript API was used to create the signalling layer required by WebRTC to setup the call. 

## Try it out

You can try out the application by going to our hosted WebRTC demo page at http://www.golgi.io/webrtc-demo. 

You can also create a free Golgi account and build the web page content and host it yourself. Send an email to info@golgi.io to request a trial Golgi account.

### Building the required JavaScript files

When you have successfully created a Golgi account you will need your Golgi Developer key and Golgi Application key to build the project. Add your Developer key to a file Golgi.DevKey and your Application key to Golgi.AppKey in the root directory of the project. You can then build the project using make.
